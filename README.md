## About This Repo

🖱️ We will be building a simple Page Clicker application with some text and a button using [React](https://react.dev/) and keeping track of [State](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory)!

[State](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) allows you to track data in your components that can change over time. When the state data updates, React will re-render the component to reflect those changes in the UI. State is managed internally within the component and you can update it by calling setState(). State should contain data that a component needs to render its output.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Start the Application**:

  - In the terminal, run the following to start the client:

    ```shell
    npm run client
    ```

The UI should open in your default web browser to the correct URL. If not, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

> **NOTE:** The key combination `ctrl-c` will stop your client from running. Whichever current Node.js process is running in that terminal will stop on macOS.
